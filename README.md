pyroomba
========
PyRobot was originally based on openinterface.py, developed by iRobot
Corporation. Many of the docstrings from openinterface.py, particularly those
which describe the specification, are also used here. Also, docstrings may
contain specification text copied directly from the Roomba SCI Spec Manual and
the Create Open Interface specification.

Since SCI is a subset of OI, PyRobot first defines the Roomba's functionality
in the Roomba class and then extends that with the Create's additional
functionality in the Create class. In addition, since OI is built on SCI the
SerialCommandInterface class is also used for OI.
